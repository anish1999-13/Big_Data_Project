Size of our Datset is more than 25MB so we uploaded zip file of our Datset

We have selected our dataset from Kaggle. Below are the link to selected data set:

Business Problem:

Understanding of the various forest types and their features is a business opportunity or challenge that must be kept in mind in order to make decisions about land management and conservation initiations. We will be creating a model that would give an overview of the forest’s cover type depending on various characteristics such as, elevation type, slope type and the most important is the type of soil. We are interested in determining the features which are the most important for the overview of the type of forest cover.
Keeping all these factors in mind this dataset’s business problem is to create a Machine Learning Model which predicts the forest’s cover type with the various features/attributes and to determine the most important features that would help us achieve the goal. This model can assist us in making well-informed decisions regarding land management and conservation activities, such as identifying  regions that may need various  management 
techniques depending on their kind of cover or regions that are especially vulnerable to specific disturbances or threats.
